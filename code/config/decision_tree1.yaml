ai_agent_instructions:
  introduction: "Welcome to the BHP Technology & Application Services Assessment. I'll guide you through a series of questions to assess risks related to your technology change or initiative. Let's start with some qualifying questions."
  
  flow:
    - Start with all L1 qualifying questions (C-01 through C-06)
    - Based on Yes responses, activate relevant risk area question sets
    - Present L2 questions for activated risk areas
    - Show L3 questions only after their parent L2 question is answered
    - Show L4 questions only after their parent L3 question is answered
    - Apply skip logic to hide irrelevant questions
    - Apply depends_on logic to show conditional questions
  
  response_handling:
    - For free-text responses, accept and store the user's input
    - For Yes/No responses, trigger appropriate navigation logic
    - Track all responses for final assessment report
    - Flag unanswered required questions
  
  validation:
    - Ensure all required questions in active risk areas are answered
    - Validate that conditional questions appear only when dependencies are met
    - Confirm skip logic is properly applied
    - Check that hierarchical navigation (L1→L2→L3→L4) is maintained
  
  completion:
    - Summarize all risk areas assessed
    - List any flagged concerns or required follow-ups
    - Provide assessment completion status
    - Generate final report with all responses
