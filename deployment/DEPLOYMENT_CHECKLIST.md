## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### First Time Deployment
- [ ] Navigate to project root directory
- [ ] Make scripts executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x deployment/scripts/*.sh
  ```
- [ ] Run deployment script:
  ```bash
  ./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
  ```
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress (10-15 minutes)
- [ ] Note down the application URL provided
- [ ] Test application in browser

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application URL is accessible
- [ ] HTTPS is working (no certificate warnings)
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Backend API responds correctly
- [ ] Run health checks:
  ```bash
  ./deployment/scripts/health_check.sh
  ```

  ```bash
  # Add to crontab
  */15 * * * * /path/to/deployment/scripts/health_check.sh
  ```
- [ ] Access AWS CloudWatch dashboard
- [ ] Review default metrics (CPU, Memory, Requests)
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms (optional):
  - [ ] High CPU usage (>80%)
  - [ ] High error rate (>5%)
  - [ ] Low request count (application down)

### Log Management
- [ ] Know how to access logs:
  ```bash
  cd deployment/build
  eb logs bhp-assessment-env
  ```
- [ ] Set up log retention policy in CloudWatch
- [ ] Consider log aggregation tool (optional)

## üí∞ Cost Management Checklist

### Initial Cost Review
- [ ] Understand free tier limits
- [ ] Review estimated monthly costs (~$30-35 after free tier)
- [ ] Set up AWS billing alerts
- [ ] Enable cost allocation tags

### Optimization
- [ ] Spot instances enabled (automatically by script)
- [ ] Auto-scaling configured (automatically by script)
- [ ] Plan for scaling down during off-hours if needed
- [ ] Review costs monthly

## üîí Security Hardening Checklist

### Basic Security (Included)
- [x] HTTPS enforced
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] HSTS enabled
- [x] Content Security Policy set
- [x] Auto-scaling for DDoS protection

- [ ] Provide access credentials (if applicable)
- [ ] Share deployment documentation
- [ ] Create user guide (if needed)

### Training
- [ ] Train client on basic usage
- [ ] Show how to access logs if needed
- [ ] Explain monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Document support contact information

### Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Schedule regular health checks
- [ ] Set up automated backups (if using database)
- [ ] Plan for updates and patches
- [ ] Define SLA and uptime expectations

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

If deployment fails:
- [ ] Check AWS credentials are valid
- [ ] Review deployment logs
- [ ] Verify all prerequisites are met
- [ ] Check AWS service limits
- [ ] Try deployment with verbose logging:
  ```bash
  eb deploy --debug
  ```
- [ ] Review [README.md](README.md) troubleshooting section

If health checks fail:
- [ ] Check application logs: `eb logs bhp-assessment-env`
- [ ] Verify backend `/api/health` endpoint exists
- [ ] Check security group allows HTTP/HTTPS
- [ ] Test locally first
- [ ] Try rollback: `./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh`
