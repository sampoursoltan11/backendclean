## üîß Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **AWS CLI** (v2 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Install on macOS
   brew install awscli

   # Or download from: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   ```

2. **EB CLI** (Elastic Beanstalk CLI)
   ```bash
   pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
   ```

3. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Check version
   node --version
   ```

4. **Python** (v3.11 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Check version
   python3 --version
   ```

### AWS Account Setup

1. **Create AWS Account**
   - Visit: https://aws.amazon.com/
   - Sign up for a new account (Free tier available)

2. **Create IAM User for Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Required permissions:
   - AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess
   - AmazonS3FullAccess
   - CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
   - AmazonEC2FullAccess (for EB instances)
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter:
   # - AWS Access Key ID
   # - AWS Secret Access Key
   # - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
   # - Output format: json
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   # Should display your account information
   ```

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure:

```bash
cd deployment/config
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
EB_APP_NAME=bhp-assessment-app
EB_ENV_NAME=bhp-assessment-env
```

### 2. Update SSL Certificate (Optional)

If you have a custom SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager:

Edit `deployment/.ebextensions/01_flask.config`:
```yaml
SSLCertificateArns: 'arn:aws:acm:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:certificate/CERT_ID'
```

Or use the default AWS EB certificate (automatically provided).

## üì¶ Manual Deployment

### First Time Deployment

Run the comprehensive deployment script:

```bash
# From project root
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check all prerequisites
2. ‚úÖ Build React frontend
3. ‚úÖ Prepare Flask backend
4. ‚úÖ Create deployment package
5. ‚úÖ Initialize Elastic Beanstalk
6. ‚úÖ Deploy to AWS
7. ‚úÖ Wait for environment to be ready
8. ‚úÖ Run health checks
9. ‚úÖ Run smoke tests
10. ‚úÖ Display deployment URL

**Expected Time:** 10-15 minutes for first deployment

### Subsequent Deployments

For updates after the initial deployment:

```bash
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
```

**Expected Time:** 5-10 minutes

### What You'll Get

After successful deployment:

## üîÑ Automated CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Setup

The project includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

#### 1. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository:
1. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add the following secrets:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: your_aws_secret_key
```

#### 2. Enable Workflow

The workflow is located at: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Automatic Deployment Triggers:**
- ‚úÖ Push to `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI

**What it does:**
1. Runs frontend tests
2. Runs backend tests
3. Builds application
4. Deploys to AWS EB
5. Runs health checks
6. Notifies on success/failure

#### 3. Monitor Deployment

View deployment progress:
- GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab ‚Üí Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## üè• Monitoring & Health Checks

### Run Health Checks

Monitor application health:

```bash
./deployment/scripts/health_check.sh
```

**Checks Performed:**
- ‚úÖ Backend API health
- ‚úÖ Frontend accessibility
- ‚úÖ Response time performance
- ‚úÖ Security headers
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS certificate validity

**Example Output:**
```
Backend Health Checks:
‚úì PASS (HTTP 200)

Frontend Checks:
‚úì PASS (HTTP 200)

Performance Checks:
‚úì PASS (0.234s)

Security Score: 4/4
‚úì All checks passed!
```

### View Application Logs

```bash
cd deployment/build
eb logs bhp-assessment-env --all
```

### Monitor via AWS Console

Access AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console:
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/
```

View:
- Environment health
- Request metrics
- Error logs
- CPU/Memory usage

### Set Up CloudWatch Alarms (Optional)

Create alarms for:
- High error rate
- High response time
- CPU > 80%
- Memory > 80%

## ‚èÆÔ∏è Rollback

If deployment fails or issues arise, quickly rollback:

```bash
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh
```

**Interactive Rollback:**
1. Shows recent deployment history
2. Identifies previous version
3. Confirms rollback
4. Deploys previous version
5. Runs health checks

**Manual Rollback:**
```bash
cd deployment/build
eb deploy --version VERSION_LABEL
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. AWS Credentials Not Configured
```
Error: Unable to locate credentials
```

**Solution:**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your credentials
```

#### 2. EB CLI Not Found
```
Error: eb: command not found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
# Add to PATH: export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

#### 3. Deployment Timeout
```
Error: Environment did not become ready within 600s
```

**Solution:**
- Check AWS console for detailed errors
- View logs: `eb logs bhp-assessment-env`
- Increase timeout in deploy.sh: `MAX_WAIT_TIME=900`

#### 4. Health Checks Failing
```
Error: Health checks failed after 10 attempts
```

**Solution:**
- Check if backend is running: `eb logs bhp-assessment-env | grep error`
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check security group allows HTTP/HTTPS
- Ensure backend has `/api/health` endpoint

#### 5. Build Failures

**Frontend build fails:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# Check for errors
```

**Backend issues:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Check for errors
```

### View Detailed Logs

```bash
# All logs
eb logs bhp-assessment-env --all

# Last 100 lines
eb logs bhp-assessment-env

# Stream live logs
eb logs -f bhp-assessment-env

# Download logs
eb logs --zip bhp-assessment-env
```

### SSH into Instance

For advanced debugging:

```bash
cd deployment/build
eb ssh bhp-assessment-env
```

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Estimated Monthly Costs

**Free Tier (First 12 months):**
- ‚úÖ 750 hours/month EC2 t2.micro/t3.micro
- ‚úÖ 5GB S3 storage
- ‚úÖ 1 million HTTP requests via Load Balancer
- **Total: $0/month**

**After Free Tier:**
- EC2 t3.small: ~$15/month
- Load Balancer: ~$16/month
- Data Transfer: ~$1-5/month
- **Total: ~$32-36/month**

### Cost Optimization

#### 1. Use Spot Instances (50-70% savings)
Already enabled in deployment script with `--enable-spot`

#### 2. Auto-scaling
```bash
# Scale down during off-hours
eb scale 1 bhp-assessment-env

# Scale up for peak hours
eb scale 2 bhp-assessment-env
```

#### 3. Terminate When Not Needed
```bash
# Terminate environment (keeps application)
eb terminate bhp-assessment-env

# Redeploy when needed
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
```

#### 4. Monitor Costs
- AWS Cost Explorer: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/
- Set up billing alerts
